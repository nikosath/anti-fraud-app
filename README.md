# Anti-fraud app with Spring Boot
Work in progress. Less than halfway done. You can review the project with GitHub's IDE https://github.dev/nikosath/anti-fraud-app
## Considerations
- Packages are organized first by feature, then by technical concern.
- I am trying out:
    - [Vavr's Either type](https://docs.vavr.io/#_either) for a more functional error handling.
    - Java 21 Records, enhanced switch, and probably pattern matching.
